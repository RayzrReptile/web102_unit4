## Notes

The use of an API for the first time added some complexity to debugging issues. At one point, I was unsure if I had incorrectly written an API call, API data handling logic, or if the API itself was to blame. I was able to figure out that it was the form sumbission reloading the page that caused this error, but afterwards, it was smooth sailing.
